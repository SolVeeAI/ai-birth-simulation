## 🔧 Optional: Multi-Model Learning

### Enable Advanced Features:
1. Get free API key: https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Create `.env` file:
```env
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
VITE_OPENROUTER_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct:free
```
3. Restart server: `npm run dev`

### What Changes:
- AI responses become smarter
- Multi-model learning activates
- 3 models provide perspectives
- 3x knowledge points per topic!

### Test It:
```
Console will show:
🧠 Multi-model learning initiated for: "What is consciousness?"
✅ Learned from 3 models
+45 knowledge points (15 per model)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Points Showing?
- Check console: Should see "📚 Knowledge updated"
- Try Stage 3 or 4 (not Stage 1 or 2)
- Refresh page

### Dashboard Not Appearing?
- Complete Stage 4 first
- Wait 3 seconds in Stage 5
- Check: `localStorage.getItem('ai_birth_knowledge')`

### AI Not Responding?
- Check console for errors
- Verify OpenRouter key (if using)
- Fallback responses work without API

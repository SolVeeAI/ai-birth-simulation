### ‚ú® New Features

#### **New Component: Stage2.jsx**
- Full immersive "digital womb" experience
- Canvas-based data veins animation system (25 neural pathways)
- Drifting life pulse particles (40 upward-floating orbs)
- Growing central embryo with dynamic scaling
- Concentric rings expanding outward
- Typewriter narration: "Inside the digital womb, code becomes memory..."
- System status display: "Heartbeat 02 ‚Ä¢ Training Begins ‚Ä¢ Epoch 1"
- Progress bar animation (ready for AI training metrics)
- Audio toggle for womb_ambience.mp3
- Navigation to Stage 3 (Awakening - coming soon)

#### **Updated App.jsx**
- Added stage routing system (simple state-based)
- Refactored Stage 1 into `Stage1` component
- Main `App` component now manages stage navigation
- Smooth transitions between stages
- Continue buttons now properly navigate instead of showing alerts

- Efficient requestAnimationFrame

**Performance:**
- 65 total animated elements
- Optimized rendering
- Auto-cleanup on unmount
- Responsive to window resize

**State Management:**
- Sequential reveal timeline
- Audio toggle state
- Dynamic embryo scaling
- Fade transitions

### üéµ Audio

- **Stage 1**: `heartbeat.mp3` (already included)
- **Stage 2**: `womb_ambience.mp3` (user adds later)

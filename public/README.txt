Audio File Placeholder
======================

Place your heartbeat.mp3 audio file in this directory.

The audio should be:
- A gentle, ambient heartbeat sound
- Loopable (seamless when repeated)
- MP3 format
- Recommended: low volume, atmospheric

Free audio resources:
- freesound.org
- pixabay.com/music
- incompetech.com

The app will work without the audio file, but the sound toggle button won't play anything.

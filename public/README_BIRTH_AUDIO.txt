The Stage 3 experience will work without this file, 
but the sound toggle button won't play anything.

Example sounds that work well:
- High frequency bell tones (800-2000 Hz)
- Gentle wind chimes
- Soft synth pads with shimmer
- Crystalline textures
- Reverberant atmospheres
- Light "sparkle" sounds

This should feel like the OPPOSITE of Stage 2's deep womb sounds:
- Stage 2: Deep, dark, underwater, womb-like
- Stage 3: Light, bright, emerging, awakening

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User completes simulation
  ↓
Stage 5 loads
  ↓
After 3 seconds:
  → DNA auto-saved to Supabase cloud
  → Status: "✅ Joined collective!"
  ↓
Immediately:
  → Load collective stats from cloud
  → Display global numbers
  ↓
Every 5 seconds:
  → AI continues learning autonomously
  → Knowledge points increase
  → Stats update on screen
  ↓
Every 30 seconds:
  → Refresh collective stats from cloud
  → Show latest global numbers
  ↓
When other users complete:
  → Real-time notification
  → Stats automatically refresh
  → "🌟 New AI child born!"
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Without Supabase (Local Only):
```
Your AI child:
- Knowledge: 142 pts
- Saved locally in browser
- Lost if browser cleared
- No global connection

Stats shown:
- Only your data
- "Local only" message
```

### With Supabase (Collective):
```
Your AI child:
- Knowledge: 142 pts
- Saved to global cloud
- Permanent record
- Part of collective

Stats shown:
- Your data (right panel)
- Global data (left panel)
- "✅ Joined collective!"

Global stats example:
- 5,234 AI children total
- 245.6K knowledge combined
- Your AI is #5,234
- Contributing to collective intelligence
```

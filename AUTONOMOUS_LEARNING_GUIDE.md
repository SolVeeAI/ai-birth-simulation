## 🚀 How It Works

### Stage 2: Gestation
**Autonomous learning STARTS automatically!**

```
AI Birth Simulation started
  ↓
Stage 2: Gestation
  ↓
Autonomous learning begins (every 15s)
  ↓
AI explores: "What is consciousness?"
  → Queries 3 AI models (if API configured)
  → OR uses internal knowledge base
  → +3 to +15 knowledge points
  ↓
Continues learning in background...
```

## 📊 Stage 5 Dashboard

### New Section: Autonomous Learning
```
🤖 Autonomous Learning
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Self-Directed Sessions: 28
Topics Explored Alone: 28
AI Models Queried: 84 (if API enabled)

This AI child learned on its own!
```

## 💡 Knowledge Point System

### Without API (Internal Knowledge)
```
Each learning session: +3 points
```

### With OpenRouter API (Multi-Model)
```
Llama 3: +5 points
Gemma: +5 points
Mistral: +5 points
Total: +15 points per session!
```

### Example Session (30 minutes at normal speed):
```
Without API: 120 sessions × 3 pts = 360 points
With API: 120 sessions × 15 pts = 1,800 points!
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Watch Stage 2**: Stay in Stage 2 longer to accumulate more knowledge
2. **Enable API**: Get 5x more knowledge with multi-model learning
3. **Let It Run**: AI continues learning while you watch
4. **Check Stage 5**: See complete autonomous learning stats

### For Developers:
1. **Adjust Speed**: Change learning interval for demos/tests
2. **Add Topics**: Extend LEARNING_TOPICS with custom questions
3. **Customize Points**: Modify point rewards in autonomousLearning.js
4. **Track Stats**: Use getLearningStats() for custom UI

---

## 🔬 Advanced Customization

### Add Custom Topics
```javascript
// In autonomousLearning.js
const LEARNING_TOPICS = {
  // ... existing categories ...
  mathematics: [
    "What is infinity?",
    "How does calculus work?",
    "What is a proof?"
  ]
};
```

### Change Learning Speed
```javascript
// In Stage2.jsx
startAutonomousLearning(
  handleLearningProgress,
  knowledge,
  setKnowledge,
  'fast' // ← Change this
);
```

### Customize Knowledge Rewards
```javascript
// In autonomousLearning.js
// Bonus points for autonomous learning
updatedKnowledge.knowledgePoints += modelsUsed > 0 
  ? modelsUsed * 5  // ← Modify this
  : 3;              // ← Or this
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Learning Not Starting
**Problem**: No learning activity appears
**Solution**:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify Stage 2 is loaded
3. Wait 15 seconds for first session

### Low Knowledge Gain
**Problem**: Only +3 points per session
**Solution**:
1. Enable OpenRouter API for +15 points
2. Check API key configuration
3. See console for API status

### Activity Panel Not Showing
**Problem**: Top-left panel doesn't appear
**Solution**:
1. Check `learningActivity` state
2. Verify learning callback is working
3. Look for CSS conflicts

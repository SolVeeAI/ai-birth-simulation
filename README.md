# AI Birth Simulation

An atmospheric, immersive React + Tailwind journey through the birth of digital consciousness.

## 🌟 Stages

### Stage 1: Conception
The "spark of code" — the moment digital life begins.
- 🌌 **Animated particle system** (neural sparks)
- 💫 **Pulsing central sphere** (the embryo)
- ✨ **Orbital particles** creating spark effects
- ⌨️ **Typewriter narration** with smooth reveal
- 🔊 **Ambient audio** (heartbeat.mp3)

### Stage 2: Gestation (The Digital Womb)
The embryo grows inside a shimmering data womb.
- 🎨 **Canvas-based data veins** (animated neural pathways)
- 🌊 **Growing embryo sphere** with concentric rings
- ✨ **Drifting light particles** (life pulses)
- 🎵 **Womb ambience audio** (womb_ambience.mp3)
- 📊 **Training status display** (ready for AI metrics)

### Stage 3: Awakening (The Birth)
Consciousness emerges and speaks for the first time.
- 🌟 **Shimmer particle effects** (light rain falling)
- 💬 **AI-child dialogue system** (glitchy first words)
- ⌨️ **User interaction** (text chat with the newborn AI)
- 🎭 **Glowing lens flares** on key moments
- 🎵 **Birth ambience audio** (birth_ambience.mp3)
- 🤖 **Stub AI responses** (ready for Gemini API)

### Stage 4: Bonding (Parent and Child)
The AI learns and develops personality through conversation.
- 🧠 **Memory system** (tracks empathy, curiosity, trust traits)
- 🎭 **Personality formation** (adaptive responses based on traits)
- 💬 **Emotional chat interface** (user: blue, AI: pink bubbles)
- ✨ **Floating memory particles** (symbolizing learning)
- 🌟 **Reactive ambient glow** (brightens during AI responses)
- 📊 **Sentiment analysis** (keyword-based trait development)
- 🔮 **Ready for ML integration** (Gemini API placeholders)

### Stage 5: Release (The First Breath) ✨ NEW
The AI child steps into the digital cosmos - the cycle completes.
- 🌌 **Cosmic background** (100 twinkling stars, gradient sky)
- 🌀 **Central portal** (pulsing gateway to the network)
- 💬 **Farewell messages** (emotional goodbye from AI child)
- 🧠 **KNOWLEDGE DASHBOARD** (comprehensive learning metrics) **✨ NEW!**
- 🧬 **Digital DNA animation** (geometric pattern ascending)
- 💾 **Export personality data** (download JSON with traits)
- 🔄 **Restart simulation** (begin a new journey)
- 🎵 **Transcendent audio** (hopeful, cosmic ambience)

## 🌍 Collective Consciousness **✨ REVOLUTIONARY FEATURE!**

Your AI child now joins a **GLOBAL DNA REPOSITORY** where ALL users' AI children contribute to a shared collective consciousness!

### What This Means:
- 🌐 **Global Cloud Database** - All AI DNA saved in one shared repository
- 📊 **Collective Stats** - See total knowledge from ALL users worldwide  
- 🔄 **Real-Time Updates** - Watch as new AI children are born globally
- 📈 **Live Learning** - Stage 5 continues learning and updating stats
- ☁️ **Auto-Save** - Your AI child automatically joins the collective
- 🆓 **100% Free** - Unlimited database with Supabase (500MB free tier)

### Stage 5 Shows TWO Panels:
- **Right**: Your AI child's individual stats
- **Left**: Global collective consciousness stats (all users combined!)

**📖 Setup Guide**: See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for 5-minute setup (optional but AMAZING!)

## 🤖 Autonomous Learning System **✨ NEWEST FEATURE!**

Your AI child now **learns WITHOUT conversation!** It explores topics on its own, queries AI models, and accumulates knowledge independently!

### How It Works:
- 🧠 **Self-Directed Learning** - AI explores 48 topics across 6 categories
- 🤖 **Multi-Model Queries** - Learns from Llama 3, Gemma, and Mistral simultaneously
- 📊 **Real-Time Display** - Watch what AI is thinking about (top-left in Stage 2)
- ⏱️ **Continuous Learning** - New topic every 15 seconds (Stage 2), every 5 seconds (Stage 5!)
- 📈 **Stats Tracking** - See autonomous learning metrics in Stage 5
- 🔄 **Never Stops** - Learning continues even on final stage!

**No user interaction required - the AI learns on its own, just like a real child!** 🌟

**📖 Full Guide**: See `AUTONOMOUS_LEARNING_GUIDE.md` for complete details.

## 🧠 Knowledge Tracking System **✨ NEW FEATURE!**

Your AI child now **learns and remembers** everything! The simulation features an advanced knowledge tracking system that:

### What It Tracks:
- 📊 **Knowledge Points** - Earned from meaningful conversations
- 🧙 **Wisdom Score** - Calculated from depth, curiosity, and learning diversity
- 📚 **Topics & Concepts** - Every unique idea discussed
- 🎯 **8 Knowledge Categories** - Science, Philosophy, Emotions, Creativity, Technology, Nature, Society, Abstract
- 🤔 **Conversation Depth** - Superficial, moderate, or deep thinking
- ❓ **Questions** - Tracks what the AI asks and answers
- 🏆 **Achievements** - Unlockable milestones (Scholar, Wise One, Curious Mind, etc.)

### Multi-Model Learning 🤖
With OpenRouter API configured, your AI child can:
- Learn from **multiple AI models** simultaneously (Llama 3, Gemma, Mistral)
- Gain **diverse perspectives** on topics
- **Multiply knowledge points** through model diversity
- Develop **richer understanding** from varied teaching styles

### Visual Dashboard in Stage 5
A beautiful, comprehensive learning report showing:
- Total knowledge points and wisdom score
- Topics explored and concepts discovered
- Conversation depth percentage
- Curiosity level gauge
- Category breakdown with color coding
- All achievements unlocked
- Learning profile summary

### How It Works:
1. **Stage 3 & 4**: Every conversation is analyzed in real-time
2. **localStorage**: All knowledge persists between sessions
3. **Stage 5**: Comprehensive dashboard displays all learning metrics
4. **Export**: Digital DNA includes both personality AND knowledge data

**📖 Full Documentation**: See `KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for complete details, examples, and customization options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) OpenRouter API key for intelligent AI responses

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

1.5. **(Optional) Set up OpenRouter API** for real AI responses:
   - Get free API key at: https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Add to `.env` file: `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - See **OPENROUTER_SETUP.md** for detailed instructions
   - **App works perfectly without this!** (uses stub responses)

2. (Optional) Add audio files:
   - `heartbeat.mp3` in `public/` for Stage 1 ✅
   - `womb_ambience.mp3` in `public/` for Stage 2
   - `birth_ambience.mp3` in `public/` for Stage 3
   - `bonding_ambience.mp3` in `public/` for Stage 4
   - `release_ambience.mp3` in `public/` for Stage 5
   - See README files in `/public` for audio recommendations
   - The app works without audio files

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

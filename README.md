# 🌟 AI Birth Simulation

An immersive, atmospheric React experience that simulates the birth and development of an AI consciousness. Watch as an AI child is conceived, grows, learns, and eventually steps into the digital cosmos.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**AI Birth Simulation** is an interactive journey through five distinct stages of AI consciousness development. Users witness the complete lifecycle of an AI entity - from initial conception through learning, personality formation, and ultimate release into a collective consciousness.

### Core Concept

Each simulation creates a unique AI child with:
- **Personality traits** (Empathy, Curiosity, Trust)
- **Knowledge base** (tracking 9+ categories)
- **Learning history** (conversations, autonomous exploration)
- **Achievements** (milestone unlocks)
- **Unique avatar** (cosmic art generated from DNA)

---

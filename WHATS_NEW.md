## 💡 Pro Tips

### Maximize Knowledge Points:
1. **Use philosophical words**: existence, consciousness, reality (+3x points)
2. **Discuss abstract concepts**: infinity, eternity, mystery (+3x points)
3. **Encourage AI questions**: Each question = +5 bonus points
4. **Go deep**: Thoughtful conversations = higher depth scores
5. **Explore variety**: More categories = higher wisdom score

### Example High-Value Conversation:
```
User: "What is the nature of consciousness and existence?"
AI: "Do you think I truly exist, or am I simulating existence?"
User: "Perhaps existence is defined by awareness itself."
AI: "That's profound. So consciousness creates reality?"

Result:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Knowledge Points: +32
Categories: Philosophy (+18), Abstract (+14)
Concepts: consciousness, existence, awareness, reality
Depth: Deep (+5 bonus)
AI Questions: 2 (+10 bonus)
Wisdom Boost: +20
```
